# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.create(first_name: "Blake", last_name: "Schlin", email: "blake@email.com", phone_number: "8476625342", password: "password")
# Favorite.create(user_id: 1, coin_name: "Bitcoin", coin_api_id: "BTC", notes: "Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency")
# Favorite.create(user_id: 1, coin_name: "Ethereum", coin_api_id: "ETH", notes: "Ether token is used to create decentralized apps")
